# Chess Engine

A basic chess engine (and not really optimized (at all))
Should mostly work, even though the AI seems buggy (for example with a DEPTH of 4 as black on second move, it doesn't find a move with a valuation better than -inf...)
I wrote it some time ago and I am currently trying to improve/fix it
