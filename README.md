# Chess Engine

A basic chess engine (and not really optimized (at all))

Should mostly work, even though the AI is way too slow.

I wrote it some time ago and I am currently trying to improve/fix it

Doesn't support draw by repetition yet

# Bugs

- Doesn't return a default move if a search results in checkmate
